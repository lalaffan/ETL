### 1. **Project Overview**
**Goal:** To calculate and track energy efficiency ratios across various U.S. regions by comparing electricity generation and consumption data, allowing identification of regions with the best efficiency improvements.
**Scope:** The project will cover state-level and sector-level energy consumption trends, highlight key regions, and enable actionable insights through energy efficiency metrics.

### 2. **Data Sources and Schema**

You have two primary datasets that provide relevant data:
1. **Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customer** (for consumption)【4†source】.
2. **Electric Power Generation by Energy Source** (for generation)【4†source】.

#### **Dataset 1: Electricity Sales to Ultimate Customer**
- **Schema:**
  - `period` (monthly)
  - `stateid`, `stateDescription` (state)
  - `sectorid`, `sectorName` (sector)
  - `customers`, `price`, `revenue`, `sales` (values)

- **Key Metrics:**
  - Sales in million kilowatt-hours (consumption).

#### **Dataset 2: Electric Power Generation by Energy Source**
- **Schema:**
  - `period` (hourly)
  - `respondent` (balancing authority/state)
  - `fueltype` (e.g., coal, nuclear, solar)
  - `value` (generation in megawatt-hours)

- **Key Metrics:**
  - Generation by energy source and region.

### 3. **Project Architecture**
The architecture will be designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from both sources into a central data warehouse. Metrics will be generated and made available via a dashboard.

#### **Step 1: Data Ingestion**
- **Source A:** API data for electricity sales (monthly frequency).
- **Source B:** API data for power generation (hourly frequency).

- **Tools:**
  - Use Apache Airflow for scheduling and orchestration of ETL pipelines.
  - Ingest data into a data lake (e.g., AWS S3) or a data warehouse (e.g., Google BigQuery).

#### **Step 2: Data Transformation**
Transform the data to make it usable for the efficiency calculation:
1. **Aggregation:**
   - Aggregate hourly power generation data to monthly totals per state or region.
   - Sum up energy consumption (`sales`) for each state and sector.

2. **Calculate Efficiency Metrics:**
   - $$\text{Energy Efficiency Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Consumption (Sales)}}{\text{Total Generation}}$$
   - Compute monthly and sector-wise ratios.
   - Normalize by population or industrial load for more detailed insights.

3. **Highlight Regions:**
   - Identify regions with significant improvement in energy efficiency by comparing monthly or yearly trends.

#### **Step 3: Data Storage**
- **Storage:** Store the transformed data in a data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery, Redshift).
- **Partitioning:** Partition by state, sector, and period for optimized queries.

#### **Step 4: Data Visualization**
- **Tool:** Use BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker for visualization.
- **Dashboards:**
   - Trend charts showing energy consumption and generation over time.
   - Efficiency heatmaps by region.
   - Sector-wise efficiency comparison.

### 4. **Pipeline Diagram**

Here’s a high-level overview of the data engineering pipeline:

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - API calls to both `Electricity Sales` and `Power Generation` datasets.
   - Store raw data in a cloud data lake.

2. **ETL Pipeline (Airflow):**
   - Extract → Clean and aggregate data (group by state, sector).
   - Transform → Calculate metrics (efficiency ratios).
   - Load → Push transformed data into the data warehouse.

3. **Analytics and Reporting:**
   - Tableau/Power BI dashboards to visualize trends, sector efficiency, and state comparison.
   - Automate daily/monthly report generation.

### 5. **Metrics and KPIs**
1. **Energy Efficiency Ratio:**$$\frac{\text{Consumption}}{\text{Generation}}$$
2. **Energy Waste Index:** Identify areas with excess generation compared to consumption.
3. **Top Performing Regions:** Highlight states or sectors with the best improvement in efficiency over time.

---

### 6. **Data Governance**
- Ensure data quality checks during ingestion, with validation steps at each transformation stage.
- Maintain an audit trail for API calls and data changes.
